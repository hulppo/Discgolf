*** Disc golf software for storing and analyzing disc golf results ***

This software was primarily created for parsing of scorecard mails from the Easy
Scorecard android application.

This software uses parts of the Symfony2 PHP framework. It also depends on the
PEAR Mail_mimeDecode package for decoding of mails.

INSTALLATION
------------

First get this software for example by cloning this GIT repository.
You will also need GIT for fetching the symfony2 dependencies of this software.

Then run the app/check.php file for checking that your PHP system has all the
components required for symfony2 stack to work.

Afterwards run bin/vendors, which will retrieve all the dependencies of this
software.

For using the PEAR Mail_mimeDecode package install PEAR and the Mail_mimeDecode
PEAR package on your system and create a link or copy the contents of the PEAR
PHP folder to vendor/mailMimeDecode/src.
(On an ubuntu distribution the PEAR PHP folder is /usr/share/php)

Currently this software has only been tested with a postgresql database. You
can set-up the postgresql database by running the SQL inside
src/Lupo/Discgolf/Resources/db/db_init.sql

CONFIGURATION
-------------
You will need to create a new file app/config/parameters.ini. The
parameters.ini.dist file can be used as base. Configure the database
parameters.
This can also be done by running in the browser the config.php file in the /web
folder.

RUNNING
-------
Parsing a single scorecard mail:
Run app/console discgolf:parsemail <mailfilename>

Parsing a Maildir unread mail folder.
Run app/console discgolf:parsemaildir <folder>

By pointing a web browser to the /web/ should see the Discgolf application.
Current working routes are only the REST controllers, e.g.
/app_dev.php/api/rounds and /app_dev.php/api/rounds.json.
